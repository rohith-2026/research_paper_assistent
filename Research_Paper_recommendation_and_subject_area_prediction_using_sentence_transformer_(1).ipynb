In this work, we propose to model counterfactual\\ndistributions using a novel Hilbert space representation called counterfactual\\nmean embedding (CME). The CME embeds the associated counterfactual distribution\\ninto a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) endowed with a positive definite\\nkernel, which allows us to perform causal inference over the entire landscape\\nof the counterfactual distribution. Based on this representation, we propose a\\ndistributional treatment effect (DTE) that can quantify the causal effect over\\nentire outcome distributions. Our approach is nonparametric as the CME can be\\nestimated under the unconfoundedness assumption from observational data without\\nrequiring any parametric assumption about the underlying distributions. We also\\nestablish a rate of convergence of the proposed estimator which depends on the\\nsmoothness of the conditional mean and the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the\\nunderlying marginal distributions. Furthermore, our framework allows for more\\ncomplex outcomes such as images, sequences, and graphs. Our experimental\\nresults on synthetic data and off-policy evaluation tasks demonstrate the\\nadvantages of the proposed estimator.\",\n          \"Current multi-person localisation and tracking systems have an over reliance\\non the use of appearance models for target re-identification and almost no\\napproaches employ a complete deep learning solution for both objectives. We\\npresent a novel, complete deep learning framework for multi-person localisation\\nand tracking. In this context we first introduce a light weight sequential\\nGenerative Adversarial Network architecture for person localisation, which\\novercomes issues related to occlusions and noisy detections, typically found in\\na multi person environment. In the proposed tracking framework we build upon\\nrecent advances in pedestrian trajectory prediction approaches and propose a\\nnovel data association scheme based on predicted trajectories. This removes the\\nneed for computationally expensive person re-identification systems based on\\nappearance features and generates human like trajectories with minimal\\nfragmentation. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple public benchmarks\\nincluding both static and dynamic cameras and is capable of generating\\noutstanding performance, especially among other recently proposed deep neural\\nnetwork based approaches.\",\n          \"Unifying text detection and text recognition in an end-to-end training\\nfashion has become a new trend for reading text in the wild, as these two tasks\\nare highly relevant and complementary. In this paper, we investigate the\\nproblem of scene text spotting, which aims at simultaneous text detection and\\nrecognition in natural images. An end-to-end trainable neural network named as\\nMask TextSpotter is presented. Different from the previous text spotters that\\nfollow the pipeline consisting of a proposal generation network and a\\nsequence-to-sequence recognition network, Mask TextSpotter enjoys a simple and\\nsmooth end-to-end learning procedure, in which both detection and recognition\\ncan be achieved directly from two-dimensional space via semantic segmentation.\\nFurther, a spatial attention module is proposed to enhance the performance and\\nuniversality. Benefiting from the proposed two-dimensional representation on\\nboth detection and recognition, it easily handles text instances of irregular\\nshapes, for instance, curved text. We evaluate it on four English datasets and\\none multi-language dataset, achieving consistently superior performance over\\nstate-of-the-art methods in both detection and end-to-end text recognition\\ntasks. Moreover, we further investigate the recognition module of our method\\nseparately, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both\\nregular and irregular text datasets for scene text recognition.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Recent\\nmethods mainly adopt integrating multi-scale convolutional features\\nindiscriminately. However, not all features are useful for saliency detection\\nand some even cause interferences. To solve this problem, we propose Pyramid\\nFeature Attention network to focus on effective high-level context features and\\nlow-level spatial structural features. First, we design Context-aware Pyramid\\nFeature Extraction (CPFE) module for multi-scale high-level feature maps to\\ncapture rich context features. Second, we adopt channel-wise attention (CA)\\nafter CPFE feature maps and spatial attention (SA) after low-level feature\\nmaps, then fuse outputs of CA & SA together. Finally, we propose an edge\\npreservation loss to guide network to learn more detailed information in\\nboundary localization.

The aim is to provide\\nresource-efficient coexistence of vehicle-to-infrastructure(V2I) and\\nvehicle-to-vehicle(V2V) links. A recent work on the topic proposes a\\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach based on deep Q-learning,\\nwhich leverages a fingerprint-based deep Q-network (DQN) architecture. This\\nwork considers an extension of this framework by combining Double Q-learning\\n(via Double DQN) and transfer learning. The motivation behind is that Double\\nQ-learning can alleviate the problem of overestimation of the action values\\npresent in conventional Q-learning, while transfer learning can leverage\\nknowledge acquired by an expert model to accelerate learning in the MARL\\nsetting. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in a realistic V2X setting, with\\nsynthetic data generated based on a geometry-based propagation model that\\nincorporates location-specific geographical descriptors of the simulated\\nenvironment(outlines of buildings, foliage, and vehicles).

But a lack of\\nexplainability and interpretability of such systems hinders meaningful\\nparticipation by people, especially by those without a technical background.\\nInteractive visual interfaces (e.g., providing means for manipulating\\nparameters in the user interface) can help tackle this challenge. In this paper\\nwe present PreCall, an interactive visual interface for ORES, a machine\\nlearning-based web service for Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia. While ORES\\ncan be used for a number of settings, it can be challenging to translate\\nrequirements from the application domain into formal parameter sets needed to\\nconfigure the ORES models. Assisting Wikipedia editors in finding damaging\\nedits, for example, can be realized at various stages of automatization, which\\nmight impact the precision of the applied model. Our prototype PreCall attempts\\nto close this translation gap by interactively visualizing the relationship\\nbetween major model metrics (recall, precision, false positive rate) and a\\nparameter (the threshold between valuable and damaging edits). Furthermore,\\nPreCall visualizes the probable results for the current model configuration to\\nimprove the human's understanding of the relationship between metrics and\\noutcome when using ORES. We describe PreCall's components and present a use\\ncase that highlights the benefits of our approach.

            "Abstract: b'Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a primary cause of blindness in working-age\\npeople worldwide. About 3 to 4 million people with diabetes become blind\\nbecause of DR every year. Diagnosis of DR through color fundus images is a\\ncommon approach to mitigate such problem. However, DR diagnosis is a difficult\\nand time consuming task, which requires experienced clinicians to identify the\\npresence and significance of many small features on high resolution images.\\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) has proved to be a promising approach for\\nautomatic biomedical image analysis recently. In this work, we investigate\\nlesion detection on DR fundus images with CNN-based object detection methods.\\nLesion detection on fundus images faces two unique challenges. The first one is\\nthat our dataset is not fully labeled, i.e., only a subset of all lesion\\ninstances are marked. Not only will these unlabeled lesion instances not\\ncontribute to the training of the model, but also they will be mistakenly\\ncounted as false negatives, leading the model move to the opposite direction.\\nThe second challenge is that the lesion instances are usually very small,\\nmaking them difficult to be found by normal object detectors. To address the\\nfirst challenge, we introduce an iterative training algorithm for the\\nsemi-supervised method of pseudo-labeling, in which a considerable number of\\nunlabeled lesion instances can be discovered to boost the performance of the\\nlesion detector. For the small size targets problem, we extend both the input\\nsize and the depth of feature pyramid network (FPN) to produce a large CNN\\nfeature map, which can preserve the detail of small lesions and thus enhance\\nthe effectiveness of the lesion detector. The experimental results show that\\nour proposed methods significantly outperform the baselines.'\n",
